TODOs:
- Make data analytics skippable (show only on initial run, don't show for manually triggered onboarding for a new device)
- Integrate intermediary firmware
- Check first few steps and put back usage of Onboarding.Button.Cta/Alt/Back
- Fix separate modal flows for backup, recovery, fw update and fix them
- check-seed step is probably still useful, but maybe it can be handled directly in Firmware update component
- Welcome screen should be used separately
- Welcome step: 
    - security check, hologram tooltip
- Firmware step:
    - device disconnected should reuse connect device prompt
    - fake animation of progress bar for T1
    - Tooltip design for changelog
    - Animations for connecting/disconnecting device modals
    - separate flows needs to be able to show pin matrix
- Backup step:
    - missing proper icons for instructions what user should not do with a seed
- Recovery step:
    - Word select/inputs design (T1)
    - Advanced recovery matrix design
- PIN step:
    - PIN matrix redesign
    - Share pin matrix component with Pin modal used in Suite
